ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SimAGoose
   Iâ€™m interested in Computer Programming, art, crafts, sports, and biology!
   Iâ€™m currently learning SQL basics, I know HTML and CSS! I'm eager to learn something new every day and think GitHub will be awesome for me! I have no relation with geese, Im pretty funny, and my grammar is not so excellent. Anyways that's all for me! SimAGoose Out!
